# Overview of the analysis: purpose
 The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from the paid Vine members in the available data.

SellBy would like to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the Amazon vine program. 

I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin.

# Software:
AWS
Google Colab
pgAdmin 4
PostgresSQL
